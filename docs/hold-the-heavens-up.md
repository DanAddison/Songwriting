## Always in the Field
it seems so easy for tall boys  
that’s how it goes  
and we the average have-nots  
need just once to know

she chose me

and the strongest has never done a day’s work  
and the weakest is always in the field  
but some day at sundown, weary and sunburnt  
he’ll walk in humming this

she chose me

i still like you  
whatever that means  
and i’d still like to  
sing

she chose me

## Crashing Cars
i should be turning over tables  
in williamsburg bars  
i should be streaking your makeup  
with poems and paintings and love

and crashing cars

i should be crossing deserts in unsuitable shoes  
i should be lighting up seas with sparks  
i should be locked in battle with a beautiful muse  
i should be tethered to the mast

and crashing cars

speed your fever!

## More Than This
one more year gone  
need i say more  
than this?  
it’s hopeless  
i’m washed up

can’t you hear that?  
should i go back  
again?  
these failings  
just add up

case in point  
this won’t wash  
and time is short

## Rider
o'er yonder rider black  
won’t quit my slightest track  
and where am i to aim?  
with only one shell to my name

gone are your homes  
and canyons yawning hungry hold the heavens up  
and your name is never again, is your name, love

the poorest strangers kindnesses   
are given you to take from his  
there’s nothing owned and nothing else   
but this

gone are your homes  
and canyons yawning hungry hold the heavens up  
and your name is all aflame, is all a game lost

## Lovesong
i draw your hands from memory  
i need to get this feeling down  
you broke my heart so perfectly  
and i love how it feels  
i love how i feel now

## What Once Was Aflame
you cannot go till somebody throws you in the right dress  
the one you want to wear  
your mouth painted red  
your blue eyes wet  
in laughter

am i the one who’ll remember you that way  
and speak of what once was aflame?

you’ve always felt like somebody else  
like someone who rides bicycles  
with your hair full of summer nights and

am i the one who’ll remember you that way  
and think of what once was aflame?

## Clothes Off
take your clothes off  
while you can  
this might not come   
round again  
if not for love  
for circumstance  
take your clothes off
