## We Grow Restless
one thing is sovereign                     
possibility  
a storm breaks inside of us

when hope’s a betrayal of trust  
and evening has lengthened our shadows  
there are no unambiguous words
to locate us  

we grow restless

to observe what is happening  
has agency  
looking at you looking at me looking at you  
changes things  

uncertainty lays like a gauze  
across forms obscuring the edges  
there are no unambiguous words  
for our sentences  

we grow restless

don’t speak  
don’t breathe           
don’t show it  
don’t eat  
don’t sleep  
don’t blow it  
don’t speak  
don’t breathe           
don’t show it  
don’t eat  
don’t sleep  
don’t blow it  

## K I L L M A N K I N D
good wombs hath borne bad sons  
the world is the greatest punishment  
and soon i will not take part  
i’d sooner that than betray my own thoughts  
ich bin Gott  

sawed off so much, broke my nose, a kick  
in the cafeteria i raise your fucking cups and drink  
i dreamt that i was alone in the hull of a lost spacecraft  
and all the human race was dead and gone  
have fun
