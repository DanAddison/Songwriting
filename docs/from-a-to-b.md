## From A to B
time goes by so slowly  
time goes by so quickly  
and i’m far, far away from home  

it seems so dark so early  
it seems so light and so green  
and i’m far, far away from where i’m going  

it’s time i worked longer hours  
it’s time i took more time out  
and i’m far, far away from knowing  

time goes by so slowly  
time goes by so quickly  

## Junction
your eyes look like mine  
and the angle of your arm is just right  
well i’m basic i know  
i know, but

maybe we’ll be touching in the morning

you got sexy crooked teeth  
and all i wanna do is listen  
all i wanna do is close this distance  
well i’m basic i know, but aren’t we all?  
aren’t we all?

maybe we’ll be touching in the morning

now they’re calling time  
and it echoes between us  
(it echoes between us)  
well i’m basic i know but i want more  
i want more and if you want

maybe we’ll be touching in the morning

maybe we’ll be touching – you gotta die of something

## Pillow
waiting has my number  
waiting has my back bent  
waiting pays my rent  
waiting pays the rent

and oh, just this once, lord  
just this once, lord  
just this once, lord

waiting like breathing  
in all but urgency  
waiting at the wheel

and oh, just this once, lord  
just this once, lord  
just this once, lord

## I'm Your Lover
i’m your lover  
i hold you i know you

## Our Backs Like Fire
heave! heave on the head  
heave on the midship line  
and all hands on the deck  
sun on our backs like fire  
we’ll be feeling like men  
when we’ve put in our sixteen hours  
and toughened our hands  
and all the way home  
we’ll be singing  
heave!

## Song For Someone
this sounds like you when you sound like the rain  
remember the time that you stayed at my house  
water danced across the windows in cascades

like your hair across your shoulder  
like your voice across a space  
and the devil on my ribcage

this sounds like you when you sound like the rain  
remember the time that you played what i asked  
you will always flood that room when it rains

an echo in the kitchen  
an outline on the bed
