## from a to b
time goes by so slowly  
time goes by so quickly  
and I’m far, far away from home  

it seems so dark so early  
it seems so light and so green  
and i’m far, far away from where i’m going  

it’s time i worked longer hours  
it’s time i took more time out  
and i’m far, far away from knowing  

time goes by so slowly  
time goes by so quickly
