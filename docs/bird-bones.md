 ## Lighthouse
climb an old lighthouse in a storm  
write an old line out on a wall  

and call it healing  

take an old volume from a shelf  
neck a whole gallon and fuck yourself  

and call it feeling  

and call it meaning  

## One For the Boys
this one’s for the boys  
that i know die, die, die  
no mother has the right  
to expect love from her child  

when we are the put upon  
alive  

until at last the worst arrives  

this one’s for the boys   
that i was, that i am  
we’ll never have the choice we never had  
we never can  

when we are the put upon  

## Perfect Strangers
i’ve never seen your pale skin  
and i’ll never see you again  
and i’ve never seen you before  
good god  

i’m gonna want you like it matters  

all these lovesongs are just conversations with a male friend  
we have a certain understanding  
that you and i can never have  
but oh, your shoulder, the freckles and the bra-strap  

and i’m gonna want you like it matters  

## Arrows
be terrifying, be new  
be terrifying, be new  
be beautiful  

it rains arrows on him  
this makes widows of them  
dumb enough to go along enough to grow weary  

there is nothing alarming here any more  
for us to tremble before  

it rains arrows on him  
this makes widows of them  
wrong enough to hold on enough to show feelings  

i’m the one that’s running in  
i’m the one that’s running out  
i’m the one that’s running now 

## We Are Not Exhausted
things have a way of growing up from the ground  
hold our slow process up to the light  

while you’re looking for and while you’re giving up on  
sometimes it’s happening  

we are not exhausted  
we are not exhausted  
we are not exhausted  
we are not exhausted  

## Someone Else's Girlfriend
i make her smile  
someone else’s girlfriend   
she’s alright  

her neck is bare  
someone else’s girlfriend  
ties up her hair  

she visits sometimes  
someone else’s girlfriend  
with those gray eyes  

last time we spoke  
someone else’s girlfriend  
had new clothes  
and leaned in close  

she shifts her hand  
someone else’s girlfriend, you understand  

## Seventeen
i am a man  
i am  
i am

sad girls in movies should be with me  
pretty girls at parties should breathe on me  
on me  

pretty girls at parties should leave with me  

there’s a firestorm ahold of me  
and i’m getting old and i’m getting mean  
and you’re all seventeen  
and you’re all seventeen  

## We're On Horses
we’re on horses  
i feel like that  
i feel like that  
this morning  
tumbling down to the boats  
with you on my own  
with you on my own  
on horses  

we’re priceless  
we’re hopeless  
we’re useless  

last one bone-dry  
misses a turn  
blisters are earned  
working at the world  
working at the world  

we’re priceless  
we’re Godless

## This Thing That I Want, I Know Not What
old friend that i lost  
what did you see in me?  
a tear in a keyhole  
left when you saw just who i was  

well i’m found wanting  
when i’m forever wanting more  
 
we were a team  
o how did it get so complex?  
let go of me  
i’m sorry, i want all the glory if there’s any to be had  

and i don’t know that  
i might be mad  

no help for that  

i can’t be kept from my work  
i can’t be kept from the next girl  
i can’t be kept from myself or the sun on the side of a house  
am i human?

## Who Has Claws
who’s done something wrong  
who wakes up shaking from facing what  
who has claws  

who wishes he could  
remove himself from the memories in you  
as a broken tooth
