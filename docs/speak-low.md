## You Were So
it was good with you  
you were so  
when i moved with you  
you were so

## Missy
girl i’m gonna make you love me make you want me

but you’re impossible  
you’re a doll  
but you’re so hard to hold  
your arms are folded  
don’t look like that  
cover your legs  
don’t feel bad  
don’t feel anything

## Ivy
ivy like her namesake  
climbs all over you  
limbs are long and whisper  
when the wind blows through

i’m an old brick building   
full of words and dust  
all is on a knife edge   
ivy holds me up  

i don’t believe in love

## I'm the Hounds Outside
i’m the hounds outside the window  
i’m the sound of the flight of an arrow  
i’m the western winds  
you’re the skinny limbs shivering  
oh you’re a silly thing  
i’m the hounds outside
