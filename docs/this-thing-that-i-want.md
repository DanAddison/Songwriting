# this thing that i want i know not what

old friend that i lost

what did you see in me?

a tear in a keyhole

left when you saw just who i was

well i’m found wanting

when i’m forever wanting more

we were a team

o how did it get so complex?

let go of me

i’m sorry, i want all the glory if there’s any to be had

and i don’t know that

i might be mad

no help for that

i can’t be kept from my work

i can’t be kept from the next girl

i can’t be kept from myself or the sun on the side of a house

am I human?
