# see for yourself
boy sets fire to empty settlement to which he’s born
forest springs from ash to fill the air where it was

boy turns over rocks to see for himself what’s there
forest tangled up about them thorn and flower

boy’s birdsongs are bright and deafening in this dark
forest’s feathered web of branch and twig hold fast

rivers run where once were roads
the water’s cold, the water’s cold
in one boy’s world
the water’s wet, the water’s cold
