## Lothario
i was just minding my business  
here comes Scarlett dolled up in fishnets  
told me she made those Tom Waits covers  
so i’d think that she was cool enough to be my lover  
handed me a rubber, i said darling 
join the queue it starts with Laura Marling  
said i ain’t got time, i’m kinda pushed  
running up that road for a date with Kate Bush  
Scarlett baby that’s how the cookie crumbles  
rolling in a haystack with Kate Humble  
doesn’t leave me that much time for your mollasses  
Bey and Solange take up a lot of mattress  
and i know you’re the girl with the pearl  
and i got your number when i saw Ghost World  
but whaddaya know, i took a detour  
Enid thought i was nicer than Seymour  
put my semen in her tip jar  
while she wore the mask from the sex store  
she had a grande soutien-gorge   
i had the lumber support, well waddaya want?  
i’m, getting on so let me get my breath back  
... having a heart attack  
but if i was laid in the hospital   
you know i’d get laid in the hospital  
those nurses love Minor Planet’s verses  
hold on i got Kirsty  
Wark ringing my phone off the hook  
with dirty talk, Kirsty read a book  
Newsnight review is soon in session  
she says her career comes second  
well i had to make her come first  
finally i can get back to my own work  
Rachel from Countdown’s doing my homework  
Nadia from Pussy Riot’s doing my housework

Rinko Kikuchi, Meryl Streep  
Cybil Shephard, Clemence Poesy  
my little black book’s a masterpiece  
but all work and no play makes Jack rude  
Shelley Duvall once offered me an axe wound  
ho! shit! what can i say?

her words not mine i’m pure driven snow  
vanilla can’t help being poured on a gateaux

i said i’m making a shit load from Connaught Road  
thankyou very much  
and it’s close to France  
where i lay down with Lena from Les Revenants

## So Much Water So Close to Home
if it’s raining the ceiling’s probably leaking  
a landlord is a parasitic cretin  
he’s exploiting a system keeping  
social mobility stagnant i’m spitting  
mad at giving half of my yearly income to some cunt  
that won’t come and fix shit that’s broken  
he’s providing a service to no-one  
we’re priced out of owning the places we call home  
while he swans about in his Beemer  
being a baby boomer at his villa all winter  
while we shiver around storage heaters  
the boiler is fucked and i can’t feed the meter  
can’t feed my hunger, on the pittance that i earn  
i support his lifestyle he supports Osbourne  
they’ll never reform buy-to-lets coz it’s not in their interests  
“screw those that aren’t born yet”    
we could enforce a living wage  
instead of paying housing benefit to subsidize the inflated  
rates the landlord takes  
what he saved way back in the day accumulates  
through no merit at all but his name on a page  
he won’t return your calls coz he’s nothing to say  
he’s nothing to contribute, nothing to actually create  
and yet everything to gain  
i wonder how swiftly he’d pay for a plumber  
if it was his kitchen knee-deep in water  
i wonder how much rent he charged his daughter  
3 years at Loughborough while i’m painted in a corner  
fuck off

## Wheelbarrow
wherever toes are tapping minor planet’s rapping  
last you knew i was Boo.. i caught you napping  
now my jaws flapping like that Jaws captain  
we’re gonna need a bigger Folkestone, i’m that catchy  
that’s classic, actually  
put me in a Penguin dust jacket like Morrissey  
i’m the baddest rapper out here, obviously  
creeping in your bathroom pissing on the toilet seat  
in your kitchen cupboard snacking on your cereals  
in your studio i’m snapping all your pencils  
running sellotape right across your doorways  
running wild, mate running in the hallway  
I just called to say...i’m too cool to say  
so i stay the same and you can keep the change  
yeah i’m the town mayor  
“for the wolf on top of the hill: the food is there”  
and yet I’m ravenous, and yet i’m slavering  
i could eat a horse between two mattresses  
i don’t think you lovers know what hunger is  
which reminds me of what Knut Hamsun said  

“the whisper of the blood, the pleading of the bone marrow”  
shit, my balls are in a wheel barrow   
i’m in deep water, i’m so shallow  
i’m in deep water, i’m so shallow  
“the whisper of the blood, the pleading of the bone marrow”  
shit, i’m hitting on my own shadow  
i’m in deep water, i’m so shallow    
i’m in deep water, i’m so shallow  

I’m the white Eminem... wait  
i’m the white Justin Timb... mate!  
i just realised how white i really rate  
there was that time i ate at the Tate  
is this record fake? never, just a little clever  
and players can be clever, look at Iniesta  
my masterclass passes muster whenever  
i fluster my competitor  
they freeze when they see how big my fridge is  
i lay my head on your chest like Zidane did  
and the terrible truth  
i’m tied for the mainest man alive with Shane Carruth  
a little long in the tooth for this rap game  
but my songs give the youth a bad name  
you look hard in the yard but your milkshake  
“don’t impress me much” - Shania Twain  

close the doors  
nobody leaves until you download me to your iPods  
i’m hot right now, you’re weak sauce  
so hot right now, you’re weak sauce  
close the doors  
nobody leaves until you download me to your iPods  
i’m hot right now, you’re weak sauce  
so hot right now, you’re weak sauce  

and now i know you’re in Dan’s pants  
like Pierre Bensusan is always in DADGAD  
that’s the kind of reference we want  
lap it up like Sebastien Grosjean  
i’ll have to break this down on Rap Genius  
like MegaMan’s arm when Magnus Sammuelsson  
detected a weakness  
if your errogenous zone is the brain yo freak this  
now we’re understood - i’m, like, the best at everything, dude  
i’m pretty good  
prettayyy prettaaaaaay ... ha! you knew i would  

i popped your bubble  
some people rather live in shit than let the world see ‘em work a shovel  
i drag the trash out it’s no trouble  
i drag the trash out it’s no trouble   
i popped your bubble  
some people rather live in shit than let the world see ‘em work a shovel  
i drag the trash out it’s no trouble  
i drag the trash out it’s no trouble 

## All I Ever Wanted
i’m sick of the band, i’m sick of this gig  
i’m sick of always being disappointed  
a lost popularity contest  
a missed opportunity knocking  
i’m sick of the fans, i’m sick of all three  
i’m sick of this shit i’m talking  
a farcical artistic calling  
what a bitch this is all i ever wanted  

you walk into a live music venue  
your name on the door third course on the menu  
the spelling is wrong but then maybe they’d struggle with  
spelling John Lennon - still just fucking google it  
and that’s one more hit on your band page  
you’ve almost as many as candles on your cake   
anyways let’s put that behind us  
you’re crossing the floor like a tumbleweed ball does  
it’s deserted there’s nobody stirring  
but emo is blaring for no fucking reason  
and you can’t be certain but you’d say the bouquet  
is pissy urinal all backed-up since Tuesday  
with the stage? tucked-away in the corner  
next to a plasma that crawls with footballers  
so you unload your gear as your heart sinks  
hopefully soon the promoter will walk in  
hopefully soon they’ll be punters arriving  
hopefully listening rather than talking  
hopefully wishful as this kind of thinking is  
you’ll be business in their opinions  
you know that you’re one in a million  
a million desperate voices  
trying to be heard above all of the noise and just  
making the noise that much noisier - pointless  

i’m sick of the band, i’m sick of this gig  
i’m sick of always being disappointed  
a lost popularity contest  
a missed opportunity knocking  
i’m sick of the fans, i’m sick of all three  
i’m sick of this shit i’m talking  
a farcical artistic calling  
what a bitch this is all i ever wanted  

now a barmaid appears so you wander  
up to the counter to order a vodka  
she ain’t impressed by these endless performers  
with all their requests for a pint of tap water  
so you give up even trying to talk to her  
finally here comes the soundman, thank god  
but now then, he’s got his girlfriend so he’s not  
concerned with, your setup aaaah fuck i give up?!  
the other acts turn up and tune up  
guitars that cost more than you make in like 2 months  
the show must go and so you’re up   
coz your set at not nine o’clock yet is now, son  
okay you’re gonna do what you do best  
you’re here to make music, not friends  
you’re here to communicate something  
that transcends all that small talk we talk in  
and the crowd are swept up in the moment  
but you’re pissed you can count them on two hands  
and fuckloads of people will walk in  
the second your last song has ended  
you pack up your shit self-consciously  
coupla handshakes and complements probably  
but your low self-esteem means nobody  
dumb enough to like you is worth taking seriously   

and that’s why i’m sick of gigs  
and constant disappointments  
they’re following me through the forest  
do you know what it means to be haunted?  
and like page 52 of Blood Meridian  
i can hear the thunder of hundreds of horses  
who else is this self-important?  
who else is this boring?  

i’m sick of the band, i’m sick of this gig  
i’m sick of always being disappointed  
a lost popularity contest  
a missed opportunity knocking  
i’m sick of the fans, i’m sick of all three  
i’m sick of this shit i’m talking  
a farcical artistic calling  
what a bitch this is all i ever wanted 

## Candlelight Shimmer
i can picture the scene, candlelight shimmer  
a hand on my knee, a hand up your jumper  
the dream that i had the night after   
you last spoke to me on the Leas last summer  
the sun was honey poured over you  
the grass was green the sky was blue  
when we met that is  
in the dream it was night we were inside a palace   
and i really loved you, imagine!   
and you really loved me back  
forgive me for being  
a human being with feelings  
when you put on that revealing  
skirt, you knew that it would hurt me didn’t you  
you like to know that you’re beautiful  
it shows in the way i won’t look at you  
but in my sleep it was easy  
being with you being with me it sounds sleazy  
wasn’t quite like that though, believe me  
it was merely cheesy..... you’re so dreamy    

when i woke up i was destroyed  
i was like a new born baby crying at the world  
wishing i could stay forever in the chamber  
where we were together, made each other matter  
made each other better, made each other happier  
and your skin was soft  
i could feel a trace of that all day like the faintest fading flame feels warm  
my hands made strange by the empty space around my palms  
where once your face was cradled while i made you come  
back to me as you were a thousand leagues  
under my sheets, underneath  
the world we’re forced to, think our thoughts through  
well i don’t want to, i just want you in a dream  

## Ghostships
and you are what you are, but  
no-one knows what that is  
and it’s hard to be someone  
if you can’t let go of things  

who’s holding you back?  
(the same words running in a feedback loop, a curse)  

who’s holding you back, love?  
who’s driving you mad, bruv?  
who’s haunting the halls and walking through walls  
to keep you from moving on?  
well it’s easier said than done  
we all know how it feels  
running the same old scenes through your mind  
keeping the enemy close all the time  
sleeping eventually most of the night  
or some of the night well maybe tomorrow  
man are you tired but how many pills can you swallow  
without, letting everybody down  
and this is the groove that once you fall into you can’t get out  
and this is the bruise that’s working through all the blues of the sea  
between you and Dungeness B  
pay attention  
the past don’t exist  
these ghostships are figments of your imagination 

## Leg Day
leg day is the hardest  
no-one understands that i’m an artist  
i need more hamstrings  
so i need more poundage in deadlifts  
my hands are two clumsy callouses  
and my 6th meal of the day is always egg-white omelets  
i’m Sisyphus  
loud as this death metal is  
i can’t hear it  
round the back of the gym  
that Doberman’s barking again  
i can’t hear it  
think i’m gonna be sick  
fuck it  
a real gym should have that spit n sawdust image  
no women  
focus inwards   
hernias and haemmoroids you can live with  
but being like everyone else i can’t live with  
striving for perfection  
increasing resistance  
resting, eating  
embodying my investment  
determination, discipline  

## I Heart HTT
felt good when i woke up this morning  
sun was shining through my curtains  
threw them open, folkestone  
was golden...  
threw my clothes on - deezus  
rolls in slacks and custom adidas   
10 minutes later i threw them on the beach  
and i ran into the waves it was freezing  
made dry land at the Warren, grateful  
to climb through the woods up to capel  
and hike back on shaky legs  
with folkestone before me this is what i said:  
no jabronies allowed that’s the rules   
no phonies, no obstacles  
downtown what we like to do  
is ride around on our bicycles  
and you can all be obsessed with your mercedes benz  
and your rover vitesses  
and your starbucks and your primarks and your designer dogs  
dropping messes  
but we’re close to the edge like the message  
on the edge meaning on the fringes  
manifest, chambers and googies  
we’re at quarterhouse watching foreign movies  
and we’re all in bands with no groupies  
but we’re hatching plans like the goonies  
for the rich stuff  
somehow we’re buried underground well i guess there’s been a mix up  
so meet us on the beach in the summer  
we’ll be the ones not dropping any litter  
what a sexy image - yeah it is thanks  
i love muthafuckin nature!  
and all the ladies look pretty as a picture  
i only really look good on paper  
but you came for the music i made  
and stayed for some strange...  
later  

i’ll start, don’t stop now  
till our lungs are burned-out  
i heart high touch town  

# Singles
## Different Rules
i touch a nerve like the dentist  
something bout your girlfriend [that bitch is sexist?]  
no stress no flex as i Berbatov  
all the way to the fucking top, what?  
CoolTouchSteamArms gleam in the mirror though   
chest out smart mouth dream alter-ego  
golden cold shouldering the burden  
whenever two men are on board one’s the captain  
this little split schizo metaphor  
better get your fish raw on this bone china  
it’s the whiteness of the whale makes it terrifying  
be this or be that i’m so neither  
bent nose Pent stream flows gushing  
blood type Russian, Reyka in the hip flask  
hair like baseline grass in the second week  
of Wimbledon this freak laughs at opinion  

different rules for me  
 
buzz off  
i’m into having less i ain’t into making more  
that’s my 50 cents; two 50 pence coins  
manifest in my fist when i pound my chest, boys  
gave that money to the neediest  
coz it’s funny how it sullies everybody else  
oh shit don’t tell me you ain’t feeling this  
i’m the God you always wanted in this cruel world  
believe, i keep you on your toes  
don’t assume or suppose and i don’t suffer fools and   
unwritten rules and social conventions  
come here to die how i curb your enthusiasm  
a heavenly body is insignificant in the firmament and i’m different   
i’m different i’m different i’m different i’m different  

different rules for me  
 
you gotta grow up and you gotta find a job   
and you gotta buy a car and you gotta get a mortgage  

## Zedbed
we got all our amps on eleven, bundle  
Dean got a quarter of green from his uncle  
i know how to get up on the roof of the factory  
Neil ate 7 Mars bars, blew chunks, then had a Twix  
who can touch this burning ember to his arm for the longest?  
who’s house is haunted?  
drop the beatbox watch as i blow up  
Porsche Fuchs rims on my bug when i grow up  
and old bill patted us down  
three times last week just for hanging around  
well i guess we ain’t as dumb as we look  
let’s circle back to scoop what we dropped when we clocked ‘em  
now we’re holding, now we’re golden  
‘the boys’ - just basically girls on steroids  
brown thumb black lung yellow bruise white bread  
stop over on the zedbed   

# Unreleased
## Come Upstairs and Die
come upstairs to the studio  
i’m out of sorts everywhere but the studio  
i’m weak sauce everywhere but the studio  
no love lost for myself in the real world  
i’m a suffer in the garret man  
pacing the boards i’m a run myself ragged man  
this.must.be.perfect  
inspiration does exist but it has to find you working  
that’s why i try to clock in early  
I’ll have time to rest for eternity  
watch the birdie  
let’s freeze this moment  
if i could make this permanent  
what an ego - what am i a hero?  
“well i’m the only one standing here”  
De Niro  
the grape vine, takes time to make wine  
and 15 years i’ve been trying  
to make something butter  
to make something better  
to make the mistakes that it takes or whatever  
i worry i can’t sing, i break a guitar string  
i stare at a blank page i rip up a drawing  
i think up a deadline i panic about time  
it’s always about me, i i, i i  
just won’t quit  
come upstairs to the studio,  
shit

## I Walk Into the Sea
i’m just another hangashore  
another dawn, another dusk at the moorings, sure  
that i will be ocean-claimed by morning  
and i’m not, but time and salt water wears upon us all at a cost  
before everything on this earth turns to dust  
i’ll be rolling with the foam against the rocks, i’ll be sunk  
as a wreck as the subtlest gesture gets missed  
in the midst of a mist as the pills that you necked  
i’ll be sunken as the reapers features  
i’ll be sleeping with the fishes and my bones are chalk  
on the cliffs of the minor planet that comes next as per my wishes  
as per business as usual as per physics as per i’m worth  
nothing i’m blessed i’m a perfect mess  
forsaken and placing all the blame on myself  
i walk into the sea to be held  
aching and making no sense and breaking no spells  
i walk into the sea to be held  
behold how cold it all begins and how warm you grow within  
when you have given yourself over, given in, forgiven again  

## Poison Bird Belly
i wish i was otherwise  
i’m undermined by those other guys  
with their clever minds and their better rhymes and their wetter wives  
and their extra size  
and they never try  
good times, come naturally  
this life’s a catastrophe  
it’s war, the first casualty   
is truth i’m lying through every tooth to look authentic  
the proof? i proved it using irony when i meant it  
i wish i wish i wish my grass was greener  
i spit i spit i spit in a pitch black empty fight arena  
i’m craning my neck i’m a pain in the neck i’m behaving sexist again  
just craving the legs and the chest of the best dressed guest at the festival tent  
and i wish i was headlining i wish you were in decline and   
i was climbing in comparison  
i wish my motives were less embarrassing   
i wish this was not happening  
i wish that Mr Addison could get some anger management  
rap battling is damaging  
to my standing in the community  
i wish this was Jon Hopkin’s Immunity  
i wish it was anything else  
i wish i had wealth i wish i had health  
i wish for myself a million things  
i wish on a whim i wish i could win  
i wish i could sing i wish i could rap  
man, i wish you would clap  

## Swift Water
you’re a piece of work a work of art    
and heartbreak’s breaking my heart when you pass by    
i remember when you passed by the last time   
blue bicycle, blonde hair, brown eyes  
Swift Water i’m craning my neck  
I’m a pain in the neck i’m behaving sexist  
long legs barricading the exits  
where my development remains arrested  
wet drenched in sweat from the tennis courts  
you had a white sun visor and short shorts  
and i never really cared till i met you  
now i’m singing Heart loops trying to forget you  
i should impress you undress you caress you  
coz i’m a rapper now and that’s how the rest do  
at least that’s how the best do  
but we can’t all be successful  

it’s stupid it’s useless  
it’s hopeless rooting for the juiciest  
it’s stupid it’s useless  
it’s hopeless rooting for the juiciest  

i’m your short straw with the smart mouth  
still holding my breath all chest-out  
chopped liver that i mentioned on that EP  
s’all dried up now I’m jerky  
yesterday on the street i smelled your perfume  
on the breeze, it hurt me  
i’m on bended knee not worthy  
you’re in watermelon sugar and suncream  
and this cruel world shows no mercy  
i took a shower and it made me dirty  
you’re all physicality i’m all wordy  
i’m a bagful of spanners you’re curvy  
and the kitchen sink  
Swift Water, Cool Drink i’m thirsty   

## Voices
i’m the one you once left, i’m the living undead  
i’m the one your mum said’s lurking in the unlit  
alleyways and coal sheds, i’m the one you roll with  
when it gets dark in the darkness of your head  
and when you undressed me and gave voice  
to that background noise, your gums bled  
i’m Heathcliff and feelings of unrest  
i’m Bigger Thomas shoving Mary in the furnace  
and everything seems so worthless  
and everything seems so pointless  
and the darkest dark seems perfect  
you know what it means to be haunted  
i’m the one that brings disappointments  
i’m the one that hunts you in the forest  
i’m the one that comes to your door steps  
with the thunder of hundreds of horses  

check page 52 of Blood Meridian  
that’s the kind of vision that i visit on you pilgrim  
you’re so vain you probably think this song is about you  
you probably think God’s looking out for you   
don’t make me laugh now  
who’s joking who’s choking with their heart in a smart mouth  
you’re aghast now, you’re a ghost now  
it’s the middle of nowhere, you’ve broke down  
and the wind is moaning through a wire fence  
now you think about yourself in the past tense  
coz you’ve lost all agency  
now that you and i are getting along so famously  
like a house on fire with black plumes of smoke from the windows  
that’s the way your soul glows  
to everyone standing and staring at this disgusting pantomime on your timeline  
Face the book you write in the cold light  
tell me are you convinced by the white lies  
that’s by the by, say your bye-byes  
i’m the voice in your ear as you hold the knife
