# OMG
“oh” she said  
no, i don’t know what she meant  

i’ll take her point  
our willful obfuscations drive us on  

in case of flood  
engulf your house ahead with your own mud  

“woah!”  
in other words “oh my days! oh my god!”  

## Return
return to me like a tongue to an aching tooth  
i will always be here to hurt you  

take back all you said, all you were to me  
i won’t hide chaos with your body
