## Job
i go to work in the morning  
i can’t believe what you’re wearing  
i’ve gotta act like nothing  
i’ve gotta keep from staring

but now at least when i get home  
i can think about you  
baby at least when i’m alone  
i can think about you

thirty-seven-point-five hours  
you got me tired out  
you’re on my mind now  
i need to lie down

baby at least when i get home  
i can think about you  
darling at least when i’m alone  
i can think about you

## Bowline
everything died along with her  
rain fell  
river rose

## Gym Rat
i pick things up and put them down again  
i quit my job to hang around the gym

i don’t know how to feel  
i don’t know that i’m real  
unless i can take up a little more space

it hurts a little less  
i’ll work another set  
into my mountain

i figured something out for myself

i pick things up and put them down again  
i quit my job to hang around the gym

## Does Your Heart
sometimes i go outside  
i stay inside sometimes

does your heart ache?

## Shopping
you spend all your life with your colleagues  
all you ever think about is money  
running on cigarettes and coffee  
you’re nobody when your not shopping  
you’re a big shot in the city  
your second home looks pretty  
your third wife is a hottie  
you’ve got three sons and a daughter

but have you got more than me  
or have i got more than you?

you think you worked hard for your money  
i think you only really got lucky  
you bought things for next to nothing  
you sold them on at a profit  
you earn more than a third world country  
you’ve never been hungry  
you think you really need a mercerdes  
is that what i wanna be when i’m older?

but have you got more than me  
or have i got more than you?

## O, Angela!
she caught on, she caught on  
she caught on, she caught on  
she’s been listening to messages on your phone

a fool, you’re a fool  
you’re a fool, you’re a fool  
she loved you

i hope that pamela was worth it!  
i hope that deborah was worth it!  
i hope that angela was worth it!

grow up, grow up  
grow up, grow up  
you keep trying to find what you lost, what you lost  
what you lost  
you lost
