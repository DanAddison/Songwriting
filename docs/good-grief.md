## All Haircut
all i wanted was one call back  
tell me i’m the real thing  
for the longest time i thought that  
you would recognise me  
you’ve never been so  
hard to please  
listen to the radio  
are they better than me?

i’m so alternative   
you’re so very mainstream  
i can’t understand you  
you can’t understand me

it’s never been a fair fight  
check your haircut  
sell the same hype  
that everyone else does

i can’t understand you  
you can’t stand me  

## Slow Move
ain’t you quite the picture  
waltzing through my songs  
bluer than a river  
paler than a whisper  
you are

oh, oh, oh my god  
no, no, no i can’t  
stop my heart

## This is Tough
how she found her own way here  
i can’t help but wonder  
we leave a line back through the trees that only we can follow  
to everything that happened

and she has hers  
she wasn’t always my girl

i fear for her  
and how things were  
and am i worth a turn?

she wasn’t always my girl

## [Your Name Here]

you’re not so good  
i’m the one to tell you  
in case you missed it  
you got it twisted

you’d love to think that i  
can’t get you off my mind  
not true
