## Mars
strong is the pull of the earth  
slow is the going and how that hurts  
we had a house on a hill  
i had to know it was real  
strange world  

we set the village alight  
i set a course through the night  
we had a house on a hill  
everything’s different here, strong will  
red sky  

make amends  
don’t make a mess again  

## Maul
we should *can*cel  
it’s *u*seless  
don’t be a *her*o  
blasphe*me*  

*can  
you  
hear  
me?*

## Palace
i’m not sure i’ve heard enough  
i’m not sure i hurt enough  
your words turn to stairwells and corridors  
i’ve built myself a palace from thrown stones  

## Sway Like This
you’re so charming in this light  
leave tomorrow behind  
put your meaning on mine  
sway like this  

old piano downstairs  
i’ll be Daniel up here  
you’ll be somewhere between  
sway like this
