## When I Was Young
i was shy when i was young  
i was shy when i was young  
i was shy when i was young  
i was fine when i was young

## In Words
i am so much chopped liver  
you’re a lost cause  
forgive me this unlikely point  
some high plains horses  
have never seen a man  
and if that’s all i was  
now i’m a blaze of stars  
that deepens the sky across   
i’ll only leave you  
that’s not the point  
i can’t believe my eyes  
you’re impossible  
you’ve got a ways to go  
you’ve got a lot to learn  
you’ve got a ways to go   
you’ve got a bra on  

you’re not so stuck on luxuries like   
water  
just who are you kidding?  
sounds to us that some high plains horses  
have never seen a man  
and if that’s all i was  
now i’m a blaze of stars  
that deepens the sky across  
do i impress you?  
i’m sure i don’t  
but when i undress you  
i’m sure you’ll know  
is it possible i’ve got a lot to learn?  
and you’re beautiful  
and i’ll only tell you so in words  
you’ve got a lot to learn  

## Everyone Dance
right now i’m back at your houses  
in your bedrooms  
saying just what i really mean  
with your clothes laid out next to me  
on the mattress  
how i assembled you

when you leave here tonight  
you will come back to your senses  
and i will disappear  
what seemed like me is just your understanding  
of that sinking feeling  
of drowning   
of fear

i’ll give you one chance  
on my say so  
sway like reeds  
fall like leaves  

everyone dance  
i don’t know why

## In the Halflight
she’s the ghost of a memory  
taking her clothes off slowly  
she’s the curse she’s the last word  
making it worse to be only me  

a terrible darkness  
a pale glow  
an ephemeral touch  
a chemical burn  
it’s hard to let go

in the halflight  
say my name aloud  
help me understand  
kiss me on the mouth

## Simulacrum
with the night drawing in i hold my breath  
i hate to wake these ideas, i can’t help it  
and the train crawls on, and i fade out before  
i remember to forget  

i don’t want to look at you this way  
a shrouding fog softening your face  
it lays like silt on any wounding words  
and pays your bills

i’ll burn down the house  
to keep the hounds out  
a distant fire on a mountainside  
that’s all i am now  

and i don’t wish to look at you that way  
a veil of mist comes rolling in again  
it fills my lungs and makes strange my voice  
stills my tongue  

(when i was young)
