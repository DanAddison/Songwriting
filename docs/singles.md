## All Talk
when the window pales out and quickens  
drag your bones from the deep  
lean into the stone again  
you know it like no other  
you’re working harder at the wheel  

and they’ll say:  
oh, you’re alright  
oh, my boyfriend is waiting  
oh, you’re alright  
oh, my boyfriend is waiting  
he has the bluest eyes  

living leaves a sediment  
a broadness of the back  
praying in an echo chamber  
haunted as the moors don’t mention it  
this is but a scratch  

and they’ll say:  
oh, you’re alright  
oh, my boyfriend is waiting  
oh, you’re alright  
oh, my boyfriend is waiting  

## Go Around Me
go around me  
swift water  
carry no rocks  
where you run  
fair insult upon stone

irridescent  
colours  
skip across this  
boulder  
such unending injuries

## Harbour
a stone harboured here, mine to bear  
can’t move my legs  
i’ve seen more than i can tell  
a stone harboured here, where is everyone else?  


am i to feel alright?  
am i to feel alright?  


so much happening  
can’t say when you’ll be seeing me again  


some days nothing stirs on the edge  
where she lays a whole world reflected like another chance  
did i do the same things there?  
some days nothing stirs but restlessness  


am i to feel alright?  
am i to feel alright?  


so much happening  
can’t say when you’ll be seeing me again  


float face down  

## Low Light
just because  
my pride  
has left  
me  
don’t doubt that I’m  
a lion  
in Daniel’s  
skin  

i move in low light

it’s such a thrill  
rolling  
in grass  
beyond the village  
from here the stars  
spell out  
your human  
stories  

i move in low light  

you’re not my friends  

## Side With Me
kind seas, strong oars  
and still you circle back  
a new thing never shines as bright  
as a much worried thing in your hands  

and i could swear we’ve met  
in a clearing in the woods  
i think we swayed softly in the sun  
i think too much    
i thought you could  

side with me  
side with me  

strange words of foreign wisdom at the treeline once beckoned you to my wooden cabin  
listen...
