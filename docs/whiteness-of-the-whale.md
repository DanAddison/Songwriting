## Hero
he thinks, he thinks she looks sovv
something, as if she’s almost

life-like

she could be thinking, she could  
she could be being, she looks

life-like

nobody, nobody but him  
her body, her body’s only

life-like

## If I Had a Gun
if i had a million  
if i had connections  
if i had a gun  
if i was handsome

you’d wanna know what i think

if i had a gun

## We Are Everywhere
remember tanworth-in-arden  
swaying on stone a pattern like diamonds  
laying prone a few simple flowers

we wished he had known  
we wished he had known  
well i always wish, like, a thousand things  
i just wish i only wanted one

remember swimming in folkestone  
back through the shallows that whispered like thunder  
piling up pebbles with my girl and sunburn

i’d love to feel so warm  
i’d love to feel so warm  
well i had to feel, like, a thousand things  
now i’d love to know just how you are

## Spine
my favourite poems read like words  
i trace your spine through your clothes  
jesus looks good on a cross  
that’s all

every inch of your flesh is  
and darling nothing else is  
and dressing windows and building cathedrals  
that’s a sickness

i could go on  
we were born, we were born, we were born, we were born  
and feel this urgent merest moment  
there is a war on

every inch of your flesh is  
and darling nothing else is  
and dressing windows and building cathedrals  
that’s a sickness

we’ve a wonderful thing

## Piano Song
he’s falling behind with asking you where does it hurt?  
where in the world?

and every time your key’s in the door you think of your dog  
he crawled away to die alone

there is a place in the heart  
there is a place in the heart

your legs were long on the train last night and houses went by  
and you were alive

you were alive, you were alive, and he was too  
the boy with the soft brown gaze dying on you

your voice took you by the throat when you were two years old  
and never let go
