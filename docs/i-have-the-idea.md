## Ennis
oh, these nights are huge  
one word from you goes on and on  
we took work on a mountain  
we took work the same way

your horse ain’t your own  
all men leave their homes and fight a war  
calloused hands at the campfire  
calloused hands are ours

bed down in a storm  
pass that whisky boy, i feel a chill  
take that out of me  
take that out of me

## Beds Once Big
i know it’s not right between us  
i know that i’m one of the reasons  
and if you stop trying  
you’ll lose me

you’ll lose me

it’s hard being us    
you’re sleeping on my chest

## Mortal Blues
when you’re all alone, darling     
when you’re all alone darling   
this house is freezing  
when you’re all alone darling

i wish you’d sit before me  
i wish you’d sit before me  
this world keeps moving  
before me
 
## Intimacy
with their sheets all a-tangle  
and their fingers and thumbs  
and their arms and their tongues  
she’ll gaze at the sunlight   
that plays on the wall  
and say nothing at all

and he’ll never know where she’d gone  

and sat at the table  
he’ll tell her things  
things about him  
and just for a second  
he’ll pause  
and his eyes will close

and she’ll never know where he’d gone  

sing “no one knows me”

## Monster
it’s yours if you need it, my number  
i’m all for feeding the monster

love is risky  
but something close gets in your bones and fills a hole  
till morning

it’s called being human

and that’s what you are  
you’re never a saint whatever you say to get through the days

whatever it takes  

## She's Shy
i saw it  
i saw it in her eyes  
i saw it  
i saw it in her eyes

a place where boys come to die

## What You're Doing is Good
you are more than lions  
we will watch you walk out alive  
you are more than lions  
we will watch you walk out alive

what you’re doing is good

you are tall as fire  
people listen when you talk  
when you whisper what we want  
when you give us who we are

## This Work Never Slowing
this work never slowing  
keeps your line from holding  
and it’s showing

your heart ever beating  
keeps your fingers bleeding  
and it’s growing

for some of us to feel these embers glow  
how you saw lions on the beach  
from the boat

## He Broke Your Heart, He Loved You
like the brush through your hair  
he broke your heart he loved you  
over and over again  
he broke your heart he loved you  
when will it stop?  
he broke your heart he loved you  
when is once more through enough?  
he broke your heart he loved you

## I Have the Idea We Are the Same
if it’s only in my head half the battle’s won  
and that’s not bad going

i thought you’d be delighted with what i brought  
if it’s only in my head half the battle’s won
