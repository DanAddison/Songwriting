## A Line Is Drawn
a line is drawn  
describes your arm  
becomes your neck  
defend yourself  
keep me at an arms length  

you must be formidable  
you must be formidable  

learn your lines  
we’re civilized  
keep company  
and pour concrete  
keep me off of my knees  

you must be formidable  
you must be formidable  
you must be formidable 

## Ballad
when units meet  
at the same point  
the forces felt   
are modern  

and the body must yield  

from moulded seats  
things happen fast  
parts made to fit  
are made to part  

and the body must yield  

on slipway black  
merge and dislocate  
the control of a man  
can get away  

and the body must yield  

## Boats
every year i build another boat from the floorboards  
every year i leave a little less to walk around on  
washed up at the edges of the room painted white and blue  
just another hangashore am i and this won’t do  

so now you know  

laden at the leeward side of my handiwork  
so much water so close to home, so much thirst  
and oh i’ve shown my hand  
down there at the waterline, this won’t stand  

and now you know  

## Deep in the Barn
deep in the barn  
my back steams  
i shift my bulk  
in the gloaming  

i made my bed here  
i’m watered and fed here  
a beast like me  
is in the red here  

but i can hear you gathering outside  
you’ve found a common cause  
i can smell a bonfire  
i feel it through the boards  

## Endurance
we lay in a fearful embrace  
five weeks since we last saw the sun  
resisting this desolate place  
our ship she shudders and moans  

oh, the heaving of her lungs  

the warping of beams and boards  
she’ll cry herself to sleep like this  
a creeping stupendous force  
a frost-bitten godless fist  

oh, will any of us be missed?

## Firewood
arms full of  
firewood  
i’m nervous  
you’re nervous too  

i would if   
i could  
pile firewood  
as high as your roof  

long these winters  
on this tongue  
these fingers  
gone numb  

a light through  
the trees  
your window  
i’ll follow this  

arms full of   
firewood  
i’m nervous  
you’re nervous too   

## Maps
here we are again  
make the morning wait  

she draws maps  
(fix me here)  

line by  
line by  
line by  
line  

in turns, in thought, in bed  
hands, knees and neck  

she draws maps  
(fix me here)  

the most elegant sums  
are the simple ones  

## Maze of Limbs
at your six  
maze of limbs  
at your twelve  
heart of darkness  
(darkness)

we move  
by night  
war paint  
war cries  

i don’t easily scare  

won’t bow  
don’t know how  
won’t fold  
may not grow old  
(darkness)

we move  
by night  
war paint  
war cries  

i don’t easily scare

## The Message
before I saw the swollen river  
Sonny sniffed the air and faltered  
I shifted in my saddle  

in my knapsack is the letter  
I'm entrusted to deliver  
somewhere yonder is a pure heart  
time and water move against us  

I said something low and soothing  
laid my better hand upon him  
felt how hard he had been working  

biting down and urging onward  
frozen clawing of the maelstrom  
rolling eyes and silent hoof beats  

timber tore across the reins  
I don't know how I was saved  
watching Sonny fade away  

in my haste I had neglected  
to account for the preserving  
of hose shapes upon the parchment  
I looked back across the river  

## Myopia
address the page not the referent  
beast in the barn  
i know you’re out there and i still believe  
in myself over everyone  

blankets for warmth in the gloaming  
nothing stirs  
sometimes I think different thoughts with different claws  
and none are yours  

nurse

## Nancy
you’re so charming in this light  
turn your headphones up high  
put your meaning on mine  
sway like this  

keep it stupid like me  
slightly crooked of teeth  
how it hurts so good  
your freckles  

old piano downstairs  
i’ll be Daniel up here  
you’ll be somewhere between  
Nancy  

i know what you are  

a memory, an echo of  
a melody, a shadow cast  
a fallacy, an arrow shot  

you’re so charming in this light  
Nancy  

## Not a Soul in Sight
friend there is a war on  
your luck’ll never hold  
on a need-to-know we’re all told  
we’re all so old  

and not a soul in sight  
there’s not a soul in sight  
with not a soul in sight  
in time  

burn down your house at once  
tear out your tongue your tongue  
i’m all the house all the mouth  
you want  

concern yourself with no one else  
concern yourself with no one else  
concern yourself with no one else  
concern yourself with no one else  

take me dancing don’t run  

i’d break it to you gently  
but the truth has always hurt  
so come and get your heart broke  
for all you’re worth  

i’m your whole world  

but there’s not a soul in sight  
i’m fine  

## Outcrop
seven ships so distant  
i can only imagine what they hold  
where they’ve been, where they’re headed  
and how long  

find me on an outcrop  
stasis and exile  
rags as robes  
rags as robes  
Danish scurvy grass  
snake orchid and samphire  
crown of thorns  
crown of thorns  

a stand with weather all of   
its own  

a low cloud of white flowers, i watch   
the trade route lay a dark line  
fixing me beneath my perfume of burning tyre and  
Death Come Quickly and catch-fly  
 
find me on an outcrop  
stasis and exile  
rags as robes  
rags as robes  
Danish scurvy grass  
snake orchid and samphire  
crown of thorns  
crown of thorns  

steady as she goes  
upwind of and deaf to such  
siren calls  
siren calls  

find me on an outcrop  
stasis and exile  
rags as robes  
rags as robes   

## Something Turned
a changing world  
a change of clothes   
rags as robes  
please don’t explain  
my body knows  
in stasis and exile  
and your shadow  
something turned  

## Take Me Dancing
if you call  
to take me dancing  
to take me dancing  
i’ll know  
and take the blue dress  
from my wardrobe  

for I am just flesh  
and bone  

i’m so lovely  
i have no husband  

and we don’t live long  
it just seems so  

how can I know what I want?   
until you ask me  
and I say something
oh  
force my hand or  
let it go  

why’d you think I  
had my hair done?  

you always notice  

## The Gift
i’ve been saying “i don’t want a thing” for years  
i thought gifts were for others   
to give and receive  
but now we’re here  

softly swaying where we lay  

## Turn Away
he was waiting for her  
waiting for her in the leaves  
arms like swollen rivers  
rose to bear her from the street  
oh how the hell could, why the hell would  
and who are we?  
whisper keep your mouth shut  
keep your maelstrom keep your grief  

boys grow up strong  
so girls grow up fast

i’d see her ‘missing’ posters   
by the station, i was young  
never dared imagine  
things could happen so messed up  
what if we’d been walking  
down the same road on that day?  
bet that he’d just come back  
and he’d make another play  

coz girls leave the house  
and boys love the chase 

turn from this world  
turn away

he was waiting for her  
waiting for her in the leaves  
arms like swollen rivers  
rose to bear her from the street 

## Who Was I?
will i keep my eyes open  
hey?  
look back the railing  
bombs away  

you never showed me a good time  
who was i though  
to show me a good time?  

for a breath it’s just me out here  
and the bay  
then my watch stops  
17:38  

you never showed me a good time  
who was i though  
to show me a good time?  

for a moment my body looked kinda elegant  
knowing that it won’t look like that again  

your heart beats like a fist  
your heart beats like a fist  
Your heart beats like a fist  
your heart beats like a fist  

## With An Arm
with an arm draped across me  
she has the biggest eyes  
but this bed feels lately  
like an ocean and tides turn  

the masochist in me is stirring  
and i feel a sudden need for going  
and who can know just what i’m doing?  

with an arm draped across me  
she has the warmest hands  
but to lie in safety  
is to stay just as i am  

the masochist in me is stirring  
and i feel a sudden need for going  
and who can know just what i’m doing?  

## 90
the night is mine, the dial reads 90 and the motorway rushes up to meet my headlights, I plunge beneath each flyover and pass each sliproad the same way you climb a mountain - one step at a time, just bending to it, do something for nothing, no moon or stars beyond the windscreen, just ink and forward motion, two lorries on a grade and for a breathless moment we’re cresting the hill three abeam before I tumble down with my mirrors sparkling, flickering, fading, 2:17am, southbound, I can picture everyone back at the party speaking at cross purposes, I think I knew all along that the turn of midnight would drag me out here, to the road, the only tunes I hum sometimes are engine notes, I’m reassured by this ugly infrastructure, concrete pillars and bridges, rarely touched by a warm hand, decades pass, someone pressed themselves steadily against my arm in the hallway and I felt it most a few seconds after, as my sleeve cooled in the next room, if a tyre blew now what would happen? A fox could be stealing across these fields not understanding, when I was stood by myself I decided I really wanted to stop time, stop everything dead, so I could wander between the frozen bodies of my friends and, just, speak freely, a tangle of lanes now merging, I roll with it, driving for my life and for the ongoing moment, hot tar smell from a road crew, childhood utterance, white arrows on those towering blue signs seem to describe some complicated dance step instruction you’d see in books before the world changed and people stopped learning how to dance from books, i can’t tell whether i feel powerful or vulnerable barreling along in my metal box making fine adjustments with my hands and my feet and thinking about the way she kept repeating something that i couldn’t quite catch in all the noise of the party, i’m sure it was nothing, i’m sure she’s talking now, to someone, i’m generally not sure of anything, needle is edging up to empty, i’ll see where it takes me, all the way, all the way, all the way
