## A Line Is Drawn
a line is drawn  
describes your arm  
becomes your neck  
defend yourself  
keep me at an arms length  

you must be formidable  
you must be formidable  

learn your lines  
we’re civilized  
keep company  
and pour concrete  
keep me off of my knees  

you must be formidable  
you must be formidable  
you must be formidable  

## Boats
every year i build another boat from the floorboards  
every year i leave a little less to walk around on  
washed up at the edges of the room painted white and blue  
just another hangashore am i and this won’t do  

so now you know  

laden at the leeward side of my handiwork  
so much water so close to home, so much thirst  
and oh i’ve shown my hand  
down there at the waterline, this won’t stand  

and now you know  

## Deep in the Barn
deep in the barn
my back steams
i shift my bulk
in the gloaming

i made my bed here
i’m watered and fed here
a beast like me
is in the red here

but i can hear you gathering outside
you’ve found a common cause
i can smell a bonfire
i feel it through the boards

## Firewood
arms full of  
firewood  
i’m nervous  
you’re nervous too  

i would if   
i could  
pile firewood  
as high as your roof  

long these winters  
on this tongue  
these fingers  
gone numb  

a light through  
the trees  
your window  
i’ll follow this  

arms full of   
firewood  
i’m nervous  
you’re nervous too  

## I Heard Wolves
i heard wolves  
across the snow  
i heard wolves  
it was terrible  
it was beautiful  

were my devils  
to go  
would my angels  
follow?  

i heard wolves  
i heard wolves  

hear them coming through the forest  
baying for blood  
hear them running through the forest  
with teeth this sharp  
with eyes this dark  

## Maps
here we are again  
make the morning wait  

she draws maps  
(fix me here)  

line by  
line by  
line by  
line  

in turns, in thought, in bed  
hands, knees and neck  

she draws maps  
(fix me here)  

the most elegant sums  
are the simple ones  

## Myopia
address the page not the referent  
beast in the barn  
i know you’re out there and i still believe  
in myself over everyone  

blankets for warmth in the gloaming  
nothing stirs  
sometimes I think different thoughts with different claws  
and none are yours  

nurse

## Nancy
you’re so charming in this light  
turn your headphones up high  
put your meaning on mine  
sway like this  

keep it stupid like me  
slightly crooked of teeth  
how it hurts so good  
your freckles  

old piano downstairs  
i’ll be Daniel up here  
you’ll be somewhere between  
Nancy  

i know what you are  

a memory, an echo of  
a melody, a shadow cast  
a fallacy, an arrow shot  

you’re so charming in this light  
Nancy  

## Take Me Dancing
if you call  
to take me dancing  
to take me dancing  
i’ll know  
and take the blue dress  
from my wardrobe  

for I am just flesh  
and bone  

i’m so lovely  
i have no husband  

and we don’t live long  
it just seems so  

how can I know what I want?   
until you ask me  
and I say something
oh  
force my hand or  
let it go  

why’d you think I  
had my hair done?  

you always notice  

## Who Was I?
will I keep my eyes open  
hey?  
look back the railing  
bombs away  

you never showed me a good time  
who was I though  
to show me a good time?  

for a breath it’s just me out here  
and the bay  
then my watch stops  
17:38  

you never showed me a good time  
who was I though  
to show me a good time?  

for a moment my body looked kinda elegant  
knowing that it won’t look like that again  

your heart beats like a fist  
your heart beats like a fist  
Your heart beats like a fist  
your heart beats like a fist  

## With An Arm
with an arm draped across me  
she has the biggest eyes  
but this bed feels lately  
like an ocean and tides turn  

the masochist in me is stirring  
and i feel a sudden need for going  
and who can know just what i’m doing?  

with an arm draped across me  
she has the warmest hands  
but to lie in safety  
is to stay just as i am  

the masochist in me is stirring  
and i feel a sudden need for going  
and who can know just what i’m doing?
