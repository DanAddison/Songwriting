## Pass
your heart passed by here  
was i wrong to lie still?  
i’m not decided...

## Home
i can’t make you stay  
i can’t make this pay  
this modern world  
this doesn’t work

run home  

you wouldn’t see  
the good in me 

run home

## Show

all i want   
no one needs  
no one needs

just this once  
sway like reeds  
sway like reeds

show me  
i know you  
only

sing it back:  
li li li li li li

hold me  
i’ll fade out   
slowly

li li li li li li

## Lily

lily-white horses  
running down sandgate road  
suddenly sundays  
lily-white horses go

my god  
o

## Legs
in light of how you cross your legs

i’ll make you my business  
we’ll have to address this  
perhaps over breakfast

whatever it is that i am or am not   
whatever i don’t have or have got  
that you want
