## She Ain't Lovin Me
i’m looking down from my window, dead of night  
with another lone churchbell chime  
the cars are few from my crossroads view  
and I’ve got red lights in my eyes  
been sat here a while just watching, guess I’ll wait  
to see another day in  
but birds won’t fly in this bloated concrete sky  
where the roads groan and their pretty songs don’t mean a thing

i’m stuck down on the same ground  
with these four words that trouble me  
she ain’t lovin me

i’m sick of my blues, I’m sick of the sight of my shoes  
as I drag myself like someone else through the streets  
i’m sick of that dumb white machinery hum the kitchen breathes  
i’m sick of these self-indulgencies

i’m stuck down on the same ground  
with these four words that trouble me  
she ain’t lovin me

and I need no sympathy  
and I need no company  
and I need no dignity  
coz she ain’t lovin me  
my baby ain’t lovin me

## Blue Eyed Soul
close to home
a storm is gathering  
when lightning strikes twice  
it doubles in price  
and i’ve paid enough in love  

and when i start falling  
with each drop of rain  
the shelter we have made   
could all be washed away  
i’ve seen as much in love  

o my blue-eyed soul

so with arms open wide  
the stricken brave their dogged rain  
if hope is a risk to run  
well she’d make anyone  
saying such is love   

o my blue-eyed soul

my blue-eyed will sigh again  
when i feel the wings  
of my blue-eyed angel who held me when  
still waters ran too deep  
and i know when lightning strikes twice it takes a toll  
but now these clouds are rolling in there’s nothing left to do but sin  
and hope  
and hold  
my blue-eyed soul

## Nothing Else
tearing at the scars again  
i guess you feel it just as much  
and hanging on a star i know is useless  
but i guess i must

like i don’t know what it means to be wrong  
like i don’t know what it is to be alone  
i hold on for you

and there’s nothing else in this room

struggling for words again  
no one struggles quite like us  
and any time you say anything it makes longing even longer  
and it’s been long enough 

like i don’t know what it means to be wrong  
like i don’t know what it is to be alone  
i hold on for you

and there’s nothing else in this room

## You Should Be Kissed
you should be kissed  
on your fingers  
you should be kissed  
on your shoulder

you should be kissed   
on your mouth  
you should be kissed  
with the lights out

## Death Rattle
i cannot take my place at the table  
but hunger keeps me here  
to gather scraps in the corner  
you can’t take me anywhere  

there’s a ringing in our ears  
there’s a stranger at our door  
there’s a rattle at our window  
there’s a lost cause  

and four walls standing  
and no room to move  
with those four words up to the ceiling  
and nothing left to do  

but hang around the bedside  
and count the fading breaths  
i know that there’s no way round this 

## She Wants To
she wants to take off her clothes for the boy  
she wants to lay down with him and talk  
she wants to tell him things and listen, and kiss him  
and miss him when he’s gone

she wants to do just what she feels  
she wants to whistle through the trees  
she wants to ask his name and take him, and shake him  
and make him see

and down there she’s the short one  
and down there she’s the tall one  
and down there she’s the dark one  
and down there she’s the blonde one  
she’s the strong one  
she’s the weak one

she wants to breathe deep tonight  
she wants to smile and meet his eye  
she wants to feel his mouth on her, want her  
and not wonder why

## Burn
this old world’s gonna change  
in the morning  
i’m on a downtown train  
i hear you calling  
the way i’m feeling i just know  
you’ll be in red when we meet  
with the city at our feet  

you burn, burn, burn  
traces dancing on my eyes  
you burn, burn  
you burn alright  

and when we’re riding home  
across the evening  
With charges scattered on  
the air i’m breathing  
O, the things i see  
Ring inside of me  
and no place but where i stand is where i’ll be  

you burn, burn, burn  
traces dancing on my eyes  
you burn, burn  
you burn alright  

say no commonplace thing  
say no commonplace thing  
say no commonplace thing  
say no commonplace thing  

## Stay
as the light falls  
noiseless on your face  
there’s a lone wolf  
at the fireplace

and he loves that you’re still here  
letting cigarettes burn out  
taking earrings from your ears  
and laying down

from the neon  
from the great giddy crowds  
from the last song  
to the hide-out 

and he loves that you’re still here   
letting cigarettes burn out  
taking earrings from your ears  
and laying down

could you love him with his eyes so dark?  
could you love him with his teeth so sharp?  
could you love him with your young heart  
and stay?

as the light falls  
noiseless on your face  
there’s a lone wolf  
at the fireplace

## Ghosts
the signals in the noise are fading  
my ears are full of passing trains as i stand at the station  
nowhere bound

there is one leaf left that i’m holding  
for i cannot leave this glass case open in a strange town  
so i’m leaning out

where the smoke curls up from her fingers to the window  
that forever frames her head like a halo

i have long been turning this over in my hands  
now they’re stained black and blue

and branded so i wander down the same old roads  
lined with the same ghosts and it’s my ghost passing through

where the smoke curls up from her fingers to the window  
that forever frames her head like a halo
