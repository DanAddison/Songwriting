## Blue Eyed Soul
close to home
a storm is gathering  
when lightning strikes twice  
it doubles in price  
and i’ve paid enough in love  

and when i start falling  
with each drop of rain  
the shelter we have made   
could all be washed away  
i’ve seen as much in love  

o my blue-eyed soul

so with arms open wide  
the stricken brave their dogged rain  
if hope is a risk to run  
well she’d make anyone  
saying such is love   

o my blue-eyed soul

my blue-eyed will sigh again  
when i feel the wings  
of my blue-eyed angel who held me when  
still waters ran too deep  
and i know when lightning strikes twice it takes a toll  
but now these clouds are rolling in there’s nothing left to do but sin  
and hope  
and hold  
my blue-eyed soul

## Death Rattle
i cannot take my place at the table  
but hunger keeps me here  
to gather scraps in the corner  
you can’t take me anywhere  

there’s a ringing in our ears  
there’s a stranger at our door  
there’s a rattle at our window  
there’s a lost cause  

and four walls standing  
and no room to move  
with those four words up to the ceiling  
and nothing left to do  

but hang around the bedside  
and count the fading breaths  
i know that there’s no way round this  

## Burn
this old world’s gonna change  
in the morning  
i’m on a downtown train  
i hear you calling  
the way i’m feeling i just know  
you’ll be in red when we meet  
with the city at our feet  

you burn, burn, burn  
traces dancing on my eyes  
you burn, burn  
you burn alright  

and when we’re riding home  
across the evening  
With charges scattered on  
the air i’m breathing  
O, the things i see  
Ring inside of me  
and no place but where i stand is where i’ll be  

you burn, burn, burn  
traces dancing on my eyes  
you burn, burn  
you burn alright  

say no commonplace thing  
say no commonplace thing  
say no commonplace thing  
say no commonplace thing  

## Ghosts
the signals in the noise are fading
my ears are full of passing trains as i stand at the station
nowhere bound

there is one leaf left that i’m holding
for i cannot leave this glass case open in a strange town
so i’m leaning out

where the smoke curls up from her fingers to the window
that forever frames her head like a halo

i have long been turning this over in my hands
now they’re stained black and blue

and branded so i wander down the same old roads
lined with the same ghosts and it’s my ghost passing through

where the smoke curls up from her fingers to the window
that forever frames her head like a halo
