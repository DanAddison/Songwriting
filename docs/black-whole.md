## Set Fire
boy sets fire to empty settlement to which he’s born  
forest springs from ash to fill the air where it was  

boy turns over rocks to see for himself what’s there  
forest tangled up about them thorn and flower  

boy’s birdsongs are bright and deafening in this dark  
forest’s feathered web of branch and twig hold fast  

rivers run where once were roads  
the water’s cold, the water’s cold  
in one boy’s world  
the water’s wet, the water’s cold  

## Across Snow
i remember you well  
come to visit again  
come to fill up my home  
come to fill out these clothes  

you’re old news  
i’m over you   
i’m grown up  
got it all sewn up  
i hardly hear wolves across snow  
sound terrible  
sound beautiful  

you don’t say much  
that’s a nice touch  
i always liked dark hair, dark eyes  

you’re old news  
i’m over you  
i’m alright  
i’m golden light  
i hardly hear wolves through trees  
calling   
me 

## Note to Self
i’ve heard you thought  
you’re something you’re not

oh, can’t you see it?

you can have anything you want  
as long as you pay too much  

oh, can’t you see it?

## Sticks
you don’t know me like i know you  
you won’t always look like you do  
in the forest i’m sharpening sticks to build with  
and you won’t always look quite so good  

tell all your friends  
tell them that  
tell them this  
i give a damn  
laugh it up  
sometimes jokes  
stick in your throat  

Yyou don’t know me like i know you  
you won’t always look like you do  
who’ll ignore me when i get through  
you don’t know me like i know you  

la la la la  
la la la la  
now i’ll sing you to sleep  

## On Writing 
i took up a burning coal  
drew a horse and rode it to you  
drew it high on the wall  
gave it furious eyes and rode it to you  

that must mean i care  

and stirring still  
cracked and blackened beasts will gather at my bedside  
all drawn in haste   
they will stumble shaking from the woods for to look on you by moonlight  

that must mean i care  

lo!  

i took up a burning coal  
drew a horse and rode it to you
