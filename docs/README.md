Not all of the songs included here were released / recorded / performed to an audience, but **they are all finished pieces**.  

They are grouped firstly by the songs in my current **live-looping set list** (excluding any that feature on albums listed later).  

Next I have grouped together the **unreleased songs**. These are organised in alphabetical order because they span a long time period and I can't put an accurate date on many of them.  

Then, the **standalone singles**.   

Finally, **all of my actual albums and EPs**, organised in reverse chronological order. Bands and collaborative projects are included accordingly. 

Any tracks that were entirely instrumental, or that had lyrics written by someone else, have been omitted from this archive. I will have missed out a few tracks by mistake, too. So this is not quite exhaustive, just exhausting.
