# Welcome to my entire back catalogue of songs {docsify-ignore-all}
#  
Not all of the songs included here were recorded or performed to an audience, but they are all finished pieces.  

They are grouped first by the songs I have been performing in recent years, ie my live-looping set list (excluding any that feature on albums listed later).  

Next I have grouped together the unreleased songs. These are organised in alphabetical order because they span a long time period and I can't put an accurate date on many of them.  

Next are the standalone singles.   

Finally, all of my actual albums and EPs, organised in reverse chronological order. This includes songs I wrote for any bands I was in.
