# Welcome to the lyric sheets for my entire back catalogue of songs {docsify-ignore-all}
#  
Not all of the songs included here were released or recorded or performed to an audience, but **they are all finished pieces**.  

They are grouped first by the songs in my current **live-looping set list** (excluding any that feature on albums listed later).  

Next I have grouped together the **unreleased songs**. These are organised in alphabetical order because they span a long time period and I can't put an accurate date on many of them.  

Then, the **standalone singles**.   

Finally, **all of my actual albums and EPs**, organised in reverse chronological order. This includes songs I wrote for any bands I was in.  

Any tracks that were entirely instrumental, or that had lyrics written by someone else, have been omitted from this repository. I will, inevitably, have missed out a few tracks by mistake, too. So this is not quite exhaustive. Just exhausting.
