## In Your Own Time
if you’re all at sea  
lay here with me  
what is there to know?  
it’s your turn

in your own time

a day is long  
another’s gone

i’ve got your number  
come out with your hands up

in your own time

## Long-Legged
she’s so long-legged

i wanna let her go in my weakness  
if i’m real quiet she might not notice  
alone she’ll go places  
she’s so long-legged

## I Can Touch You
you are not above your 5 feet 5 inches  
i have not given up  
your skin burns  
isn’t that enough?

you’re in a world  
it can touch you  
i can touch you  
i can touch you

you’ve felt a thousand tiny disappointments  
miss perfect  
hear these words  
i won’t write them any faster  
(sometimes we expect a more complicated answer)

you’re in a world  
it can touch you  
i can touch you  
i can touch you

you never thought that i could surprise you

## Kicking Through Leaves
my time’s wasting again  
my heart’s racing again  
oh no  
she’s so pretty

she’ll say ‘grow up’

this scene needs writing again  
to mean something again  
it’s the same old story  
don’t encourage me

## A Shock of White

one song to reach her golden  
and stand at the bedside  
black swans with wings aloft 
disclose a shock of white

i’m not all bad  
i owe her that

one song the stone in my shoe  
will never wear away  
will polish bright and smooth  
will have a cripple to explain

will tell i loved her

i’m not all bad  
i owe her that  
one song to reach her golden

## The Taxidermist
the taxidermist  
in his parent’s basement  
dreams, aches for  
impossible beautiful fishes

light dancing on scales  
silver and green  
he’s the best in the world  
and his mother weeps

well take this one in my palm  
what did i think would happen?  
Everything slips away

his stranger’s stammer  
insists upon  
each tiny perfect moment  
too long
